title: The Colonnade
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The Colonnade encompasses six [[columns]].  Each column is a direct [[gate]] from [[the World]] to [[the Astral]].   Columns are typically governed by some kind of deity which may or may not be known to the peoples of the World.  The deities are regarded as the [[gods]] and during certain [[epochs]] will manifest themselves into the World for better or worse.
