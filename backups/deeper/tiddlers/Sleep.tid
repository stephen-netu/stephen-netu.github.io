title: Sleep
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The denizens of [[the World]] do not require sleep.  Most [[species|Species]] do some kind of meditation or simply rest during the darker hours of the day, usually when only the [[Pale Sun]] is visible in the sky.

Many homes are designed to include some kind of "dark room" where rest can occur as needed, which may or may not include a kind of bed.  This varies depending on the [[species or race|Species]].
