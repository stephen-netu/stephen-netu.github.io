[{"text":"Today I helped my pa build a porch.  I worked hard.  We did not finish it as it has taken many days already but I can now see our efforts being brought into completion.\n\nI thought it would rain, but it did not.\n\nI am considering becoming an electrician.  \n\nI ate much cake that my stepma had baked; it was just box cake but still tasty, as they always are.\n\nIt is already so late and I feel as if I did not do many of the things I had wanted and that disappoints me in a way I cannot adequately describe.  I hope tomorrow allows me more time yet I know time will be precisely as it always has been; that is always the thing, ain't it.\n\nI smell petrichor; perhaps it did drizzle a bit.  I will walk the trash to the road and investigate.  \n\nIt might have drizzled, albeit so brief.  The neighbors had a fire lit; they also had some tables and chairs sat upon some plastic stretched out upon the ground.  I am not certain, but they seemed to have had a small television or something, too, but in this day and age, it could have been some kind of phone or tablet just giving on an immaculate light; I simply do not know.  My stepma commented how it was a nice night for a fire; it certainly is--it certainly was.  The hour is now light and I must retire but it was, indeed, a nice night for a fire.","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","title":"25th May 2020","tags":"Journal","revision":"0","modified":"20200526215558241","created":"20200526013834194","bag":"default"},{"text":"I know that today I will accomplish little and have come to terms with that; however, for the past, let's say, two and a half hours I have made great strides in getting this environment set up.
